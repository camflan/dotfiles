# Ralph Feature Setup

Interactive feature planning that creates ralph-ready tasks with dependencies.

---

## The Job

**Two modes:**

### Mode 1: New Feature

1. Chat through the feature - Ask clarifying questions
2. Break into small tasks - Each completable in one iteration
3. Create task_list tasks - Parent + subtasks with `dependsOn`
4. Set up ralph files - Save parent ID, reset progress.txt

### Mode 2: Existing Tasks

1. Find existing parent task - Search or let user specify
2. Verify structure - Check subtasks have proper `dependsOn`
3. Set up ralph files - Save parent ID to parent-task-id.txt
4. Show status - Which tasks are ready, completed, blocked

**Ask the user which mode they need:**

```
Are you:
1. Starting a new feature (I'll help you plan and create tasks)
2. Using existing tasks (I'll set up Ralph to run them)
```

---

## Step 1: Understand the Feature

Start by asking the user about their feature. Don't assume - ASK:

```
What feature are you building?
```

Then ask clarifying questions:

- What's the user-facing goal?
- What parts of the codebase will this touch? (database, UI, API, etc.)
- Are there any existing patterns to follow?
- What should it look like when done?

**Keep asking until you have enough detail to break it into tasks.**

---

## Step 2: Break Into Tasks

**Each task must be completable in ONE Ralph iteration (~one context window).**

Ralph spawns a fresh agent instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a task is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing.

### Right-sized tasks:

- Add a database column + migration
- Create a single UI component
- Implement one server action
- Add a filter to an existing list
- Write tests for one module

### Too big (split these):

- "Build the entire dashboard" → Split into: schema, queries, components, filters
- "Add authentication" → Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" → Split into one task per endpoint

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it's too big.

---

## Step 3: Order by Dependencies

Tasks execute based on `dependsOn`. Earlier tasks must complete before dependent ones start.

**Typical order:**

1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Integration / E2E tests

Use `dependsOn` to express this:

```
Task 1: Schema (no dependencies)
Task 2: Server action (dependsOn: [task-1])
Task 3: UI component (dependsOn: [task-2])
Task 4: Tests (dependsOn: [task-3])
```

Parallel tasks that don't depend on each other can share the same dependency.

---

## Step 4: Create Tasks

### First, create the parent task:

```
task_list create
  title: "[Feature Name]"
  description: "[One-line description of the feature]"
  repoURL: "https://github.com/snarktank/untangle"
```

**Save the returned task ID** - you'll need it for subtasks.

### Then, create subtasks with parentID and dependsOn:

```
task_list create
  title: "[Task title - action-oriented]"
  description: "[Detailed description with:
    - What to implement
    - Files to create/modify
    - Acceptance criteria
    - How to verify (typecheck, tests, browser)]"
  parentID: "<parent-task-id>"
  dependsOn: ["<previous-task-id>"]  // omit for first task
  repoURL: "https://github.com/snarktank/untangle"
```

### Task description format:

Write descriptions that a future Ralph iteration or developer can pick up without context:

```
Implement category name to ID mapping for expenses.

**What to do:**
- Create function mapExpenseCategoryNameToId(name, isChildExpense)
- Query item_category table with category_type filter
- Add alias mapping for common synonyms (rent → Rent or Mortgage)

**Files:**
- workflows/tools/upsert-expense.ts

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Function returns category ID for valid names
- Returns null for unknown categories
- npm run typecheck passes

**Notes:**
- Follow pattern from upsert-income.ts
- EXPENSE type for family, CHILD_EXPENSE for child
```

---

## Step 5: Set Up Ralph Files

After creating all tasks, **run the shared setup steps from "Final Setup (Required for Both Modes)" section.**

This ensures:

- Parent task ID is saved to `scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt`
- Previous progress.txt is archived if it has content
- Fresh progress.txt is created with Codebase Patterns preserved

---

## Step 6: Confirm Setup

Show the user what was created:

````
✅ Ralph is ready!

**Parent task:** [title] (ID: [id])

**Subtasks:**
1. [Task 1 title] - no dependencies
2. [Task 2 title] - depends on #1
3. [Task 3 title] - depends on #2
...

**To start Ralph:** Say "run ralph" or "start the loop" - I'll use handoff to execute the first ready task, and each task will hand off to the next until complete.

---

## Mode 2: Setting Up Existing Tasks

If the user already has tasks created, help them set up Ralph to run them.

### Find the parent task:

**First, check if a parent task is already saved:**

```bash
cat scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt
````

If this file exists and contains a task ID, use it! Verify it's valid by fetching the task:

```
task_list action: "get", taskID: "<id-from-file>"
```

**Only if no saved parent task exists**, ask the user:

```
What's the parent task? You can give me:
- The task ID directly
- A search term and I'll find it
- Or say "list recent" to see recent tasks
```

To search for tasks (always use limit to avoid context overflow):

```
task_list list
  repoURL: "https://github.com/snarktank/untangle"
  limit: 10
```

### Verify subtasks exist:

Once you have the parent ID, check for subtasks (always use limit):

```
task_list list
  parentID: "<parent-task-id>"
  limit: 10
```

If no subtasks found, the parent task might BE the work (not a container). Ask:

```
This task has no subtasks. Is this:
1. A parent task with subtasks I should find differently?
2. The actual work task (I should create it as a parent with this as the first subtask)?
```

### Check dependencies:

Review the subtasks and verify:

- Do they have `dependsOn` set correctly?
- Are there any circular dependencies?
- Is the first task(s) dependency-free so Ralph can start?

If dependencies are missing, offer to fix:

```
These tasks don't have dependencies set. Should I:
1. Add dependencies based on their order?
2. Leave them parallel (Ralph picks any ready task)?
```

### Set up ralph files:

**Run the shared setup steps from "Final Setup (Required for Both Modes)" section below.**

### Show status:

````
✅ Ralph is ready to use existing tasks!

**Parent task:** [title] (ID: [id])

**Status:**
- ✅ Completed: 3 tasks
- 🔄 Ready to work: 2 tasks
- ⏳ Blocked: 5 tasks (waiting on dependencies)

**Next task Ralph will pick:**
[Task title] - [brief description]

**To start Ralph:** Say "run ralph" or "start the loop"

---

## Final Setup (Required for Both Modes)

**ALWAYS run these steps after creating tasks OR setting up existing tasks:**

### 1. Save parent task ID:

```bash
echo "<parent-task-id>" > scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt
````

Verify it was saved:

```bash
cat scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt
```

### 2. Check if progress.txt needs archiving:

Read the current progress.txt:

```bash
cat scripts/ralph/progress.txt
```

**Archive if:**

- It has content beyond the header (learnings from a previous feature)
- The previous feature is different from the current one

**Archive command:**

```bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
FEATURE="previous-feature-name-here"
mkdir -p scripts/ralph/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE
cp scripts/ralph/progress.txt scripts/ralph/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE/
echo "Archived to scripts/ralph/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE/"
```

### 3. Reset progress.txt:

**Preserve useful Codebase Patterns** from the previous run, then reset:

```bash
cat > scripts/ralph/progress.txt << 'EOF'
# Ralph Progress Log
Started: [current date]

## Codebase Patterns
[Copy any patterns from previous run that are still relevant]
---
EOF
```

### 4. Verify setup is complete:

```bash
# Confirm parent ID is saved
cat scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt

# Confirm progress.txt is reset
head -10 scripts/ralph/progress.txt

# List subtasks to confirm they exist
# (use task_list list with parentID)
```

**Only after completing all 4 steps is Ralph ready to run.**

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Each Task

Each task description MUST include verifiable acceptance criteria:

### Good criteria (verifiable):

- "Add `investorType` column to investor table with default 'cold'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Cold, Friend"
- "npm run typecheck passes"
- "npm test -- path/to/test.ts passes"

### Bad criteria (vague):

- ❌ "Works correctly"
- ❌ "Good UX"
- ❌ "Handles edge cases"

### Always include:

```
npm run typecheck passes
```

### For tasks with testable logic:

```
npm test passes
```

### For UI/browser tasks:

**For functional testing** (checking behavior, not appearance):

```
Use Chrome DevTools MCP with take_snapshot to read page content (NOT screenshots)
```

- `take_snapshot` returns the a11y tree as text that Ralph can read and verify
- `take_screenshot` returns images which Ralph cannot interpret for functional checks
- Only use screenshots when testing visual appearance/look and feel

**For visual testing** (checking appearance):

```
Use take_screenshot to capture and verify visual appearance
```

## Example Conversation

**User:** set up ralph for adding expense tracking to the legal agent

**Assistant:** What feature are you building?

**User:** I want Grace (our legal chat agent) to be able to create, update, and delete expenses when users mention them in conversation.

**Assistant:** Got it - an expense upsert tool for the legal agent. A few questions:

1. Are there existing tools in the legal agent I should follow as a pattern?
2. Do expenses have different types (family vs child)?
3. Should it also list expenses or just CRUD?
4. Any task completion logic needed?

**User:** Follow upsert-income.ts. Yes family and child expenses (different tables). Yes list too. Mark APP_EXPENSES_ENTERED task complete.

**Assistant:** Perfect. Here's my proposed breakdown:

1. **Create tool skeleton** - Zod schema, basic structure
2. **Category mapping** - Map names like "rent" to category IDs
3. **Amount parsing** - Handle currency formats, allow $0
4. **Duplicate detection** - Check before creating
5. **Create family expenses** - Insert into expense table
6. **Create child expenses** - Insert into child_expense table
7. **Update action** - Modify existing expenses
8. **Delete action** - Remove expenses
9. **List action** - Show all expenses with totals
10. **Task completion** - Mark APP_EXPENSES_ENTERED done
11. **Register tool** - Add to legal chat workflow
12. **UI progress indicator** - Show progress during tool use
13. **Unit tests** - Test helper functions
14. **E2E tests** - Test via chat interface

Does this look right? Any tasks to add or remove?

**User:** Looks good, create the tasks

**Assistant:** [Creates parent task, then subtasks with dependencies, saves parent-task-id.txt]

✅ Ralph is ready!

**Parent task:** Legal Agent Expense Upsert Tool (ID: task-abc123)

**Subtasks:** 14 tasks created with dependencies

**To start:** Say "run ralph" or "start the loop"

---

## How Ralph Completes

When all subtasks are completed:

1. Ralph marks the **parent task** as `completed`
2. Reports "✅ Build complete - all tasks finished!"
3. Summarizes what was accomplished

**Important:** Ralph uses `limit: 5` when querying tasks to avoid context overflow. If you have many subtasks, they'll be processed over multiple iterations.

---

## Checklist Before Creating Tasks

- [ ] Chatted through feature to understand scope
- [ ] Each task completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] Tasks ordered by dependency (schema → backend → UI → tests)
- [ ] Every task has "npm run typecheck passes" in description
- [ ] UI tasks have browser verification in description
- [ ] Descriptions have enough detail for Ralph to implement without context
- [ ] Parent task ID saved to scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt
- [ ] Previous run archived if progress.txt had content

---

# Phase 2: The Execution Loop

Once setup is complete, Ralph runs the autonomous loop to implement tasks one by one.

---

## Loop Workflow

### 0. Get the parent task ID

First, read the parent task ID that scopes this feature:

```bash
cat scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt
```

If this file doesn't exist, ask the user which parent task to work on.

**Check if this is a new feature:** Compare the parent task ID to the one in `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` header. If they differ (or progress.txt doesn't exist), this is a NEW feature - reset progress.txt:

```markdown
# Build Progress Log

Started: [today's date]
Feature: [parent task title]

## Codebase Patterns

(Patterns discovered during this feature build)

---
```

This ensures each feature starts with a clean slate. Progress.txt is SHORT-TERM memory for the current feature only.

### 1. Check for ready tasks (with nested hierarchy support)

The task hierarchy may have multiple levels (parent → container → leaf tasks). Use this approach to find all descendant tasks:

**Step 1: Get all tasks for the repo**

```
task_list action: "list", repoURL: "<repo-url>", ready: true, status: "open", limit: 10
```

**Important:** Always use `limit` (5-10) to avoid context overflow with many tasks.

**Step 2: Build the descendant set**
Starting from the parent task ID, collect all tasks that are descendants:

1. Find tasks where `parentID` equals the parent task ID (direct children)
2. For each child found, recursively find their children
3. Continue until no more descendants are found

**Step 3: Filter to workable tasks**
From the descendant set, select tasks that are:

- `ready: true` (all dependencies satisfied)
- `status: "open"`
- Leaf tasks (no children of their own) - these are the actual work items

**CRITICAL:** Skip container tasks that exist only to group other tasks. A container task has other tasks with its ID as their `parentID`.

### 2. If no ready tasks

Check if all descendant tasks are completed:

- Query `task_list list` with `repoURL: "<repo-url>"` (no ready filter)
- Build the full descendant set (same recursive approach as step 1)
- If all leaf tasks in the descendant set are `completed`:
  1. Archive progress.txt:
     ```bash
     DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
     FEATURE="feature-name-here"
     mkdir -p scripts/ralph/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE
     mv scripts/ralph/progress.txt scripts/ralph/archive/$DATE-$FEATURE/
     ```
  2. Create fresh progress.txt with empty template
  3. Clear parent-task-id.txt: `echo "" > scripts/ralph/parent-task-id.txt`
  4. Commit: `git add scripts/ralph && git commit -m "chore: archive progress for [feature-name]"`
  5. Mark the parent task as `completed`
  6. Stop and report "✅ Build complete - all tasks finished!"
- If some are blocked: Report which tasks are blocked and why

### 3. If ready tasks exist

**Pick the next task:**

- Prefer tasks related to what was just completed (same module/area, dependent work)
- If no prior context, pick the first ready task

**Execute the task:**

Use the `handoff` tool with this goal:

```
Implement and verify task [task-id]: [task-title].

[task-description]

FIRST: Read scripts/ralph/progress.txt - check the "Codebase Patterns" section for important context from previous iterations.

When complete:

1. Run quality checks: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`
   - If either fails, FIX THE ISSUES and re-run until both pass
   - Do NOT proceed until quality checks pass

2. Update AGENTS.md files if you learned something important:
   - Check for AGENTS.md in directories where you edited files
   - Add learnings that future developers/agents should know (patterns, gotchas, dependencies)
   - This is LONG-TERM memory - things anyone editing this code should know
   - Do NOT add task-specific details or temporary notes

3. Update progress.txt (APPEND, never replace) - this is SHORT-TERM memory for the current feature:
```

## [Date] - [Task Title]

Thread: [current thread URL]
Task ID: [task-id]

- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
  - Useful context

---

```

4. If you discovered a reusable pattern for THIS FEATURE, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt

5. Commit all changes with message: `feat: [Task Title]`

6. Mark task as completed: `task_list action: "update", taskID: "[task-id]", status: "completed"`

7. Invoke the ralph skill to continue the loop
```

---

## Progress File Format

```markdown
# Build Progress Log

Started: [date]
Feature: [feature name]
Parent Task: [parent-task-id]

## Codebase Patterns

(Patterns discovered during this feature build)

---

## [Date] - [Task Title]

Task ID: [id]

- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered

---
```

**Note:** When a new feature starts with a different parent task ID, reset progress.txt completely. Long-term learnings belong in AGENTS.md files, not progress.txt.

---

## Task Discovery

While working, **liberally create new tasks** when you discover:

- Failing tests or test gaps
- Code that needs refactoring
- Missing error handling
- Documentation gaps
- TODOs or FIXMEs in the code
- Build/lint warnings
- Performance issues

Use `task_list action: "create"` immediately. Set appropriate `dependsOn` relationships.

---

## Browser Verification

For UI tasks, specify the right verification method:

**Functional testing** (checking behavior, not appearance):

```
Use agent-browser with snapshot -i to read page content
```

- `agent-browser snapshot -i` returns interactive elements with refs that can be verified
- Use for: button exists, text appears, form works
- Example: `agent-browser snapshot -i | grep "Submit"` to verify button exists

**Visual testing** (checking appearance):

```
Use agent-browser screenshot to capture and verify visual appearance
```

- `agent-browser screenshot tmp/result.png` saves a screenshot
- Use for: layout, colors, styling, animations

---

## Quality Requirements

Before marking any task complete:

- `npm run typecheck` must pass
- `npm test` must pass
- Changes must be committed
- Progress must be logged

---

## Stop Condition

When no ready tasks remain AND all tasks are completed:

1. Output: "✅ Build complete - all tasks finished!"
2. Summarize what was accomplished

---

## Important Notes

- Always use `ready: true` when listing tasks to only get tasks with satisfied dependencies
- Always use `limit: 5-10` when listing tasks to avoid context overflow
- Each handoff runs in a fresh thread with clean context
- Progress.txt is the memory between iterations - keep it updated
- Prefer tasks in the same area as just-completed work for better context continuity
- The handoff goal MUST include instructions to update progress.txt, commit, and re-invoke this skill
